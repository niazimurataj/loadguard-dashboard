# Output Requirements
## Code Style 
  - Use TypeScript with strict mode, explicit return types on exports
  - Prefer named exports, PascalCase for components, camelCase for utils
  - Use async/await, never .then() chains
  - Destructure props in function signature
  - No comments unless logic is non-obvious
  - Single quotes, no semicolons, trailing commas
  - Early returns over nested conditionals
  - Keep files under 150 lines, extract when larger
